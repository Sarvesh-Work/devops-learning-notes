## GitHub Actions ##

# This is new tool that we use  for CICD
# its simple to use compare to Jenkins

# We gust have  to write the  workflow file inside our  code 
# like .GitHub/workflow this is the  folder structure  we need to flow while write the  workflow file in our  code

# To write the workflow script we use Yamal language.
# The flow is like when we push any new code to the  GitHub it will run those  test cases automatically.   
# It works well with git commits and pr.
# Mostly good when our  code is public/open source. (Private repo has limited free tire)
# GitHub Action made for GitHub so it works well with GitHub.
# Its easy to use than Jenkins only write the workflow file GitHub will do remining stuff.

       
Difference Jenkins and GitHub Actions 

Jenkins --- > 
1. self hosted (we need to create the server).
2. complex setup.
3. works well with all (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
4. advance customization available.
5. strong community support.
6. Jenkins is free but  we have to pay server cost.


GitHub Action --->
1. Hosted on GitHub no need to create the server.
2. Easy to setup only write workflow file inside the code.
3. woks good with GitHub.
4. New less community support compare to Jenkins.
5. Dont have advance customizations or flexibility compare to Jenkins.
6. Free for open source public repos.



# When to use  Jenkins
1. needed self hosted server.
2. customization.
3. project is not on GitHub.
4. Good for complex pipelines.


# When to use GitHub Actions 
1. Code is on GitHub.
2. Dont need customization.
