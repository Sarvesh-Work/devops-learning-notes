*** KUBERNETES ARCHITECTURE ***

1. we install Kubernetes on a cluster (group of computers/ec2/machines)
2. Kubernetes has 2 types of nodes
         a. Master Node
         b. Worker Node
  Master Node -> this has a Control Plane that controls all the Worker Nodes
  Worker Node -> this is where our containers/pods are present, inside those containers the applications run

## we can have multiple Worker Nodes ##

## components of Worker Nodes

1. kubelet -> helps to run the pods/containers continuously, monitors all the pods present on the Worker Node
   if any pod goes down, it tells the Container Runtime (containerd default runtime) to start the pod, and also reports to the Master Control Plane

2. container runtime -> runs the pods/containers and provides the environment for running

3. kube-proxy -> handles networking and IP assignment for pods

## components of Master Node or Control Plane

1. API Server -> brain of the cluster
   entry point of the cluster
   every command hits the API Server
   manages the state of pods
   validates requests
   communicates with Worker Node kubelet

2. Scheduler -> used to deploy pods on Worker Nodes
   takes pending pods from API Server and selects the best Worker Node for them
   decision based on CPU, RAM, Storage etc

3. etcd -> like a database
   stores the state of pods
   only API Server communicates with it
   also acts as backup because it stores previous states too

4. controllers -> this continuously monitors the cluster state 
and checks the actual state and desireds  state according to that do the modification.
controller only sends request to api server then api server tells kubelet which is on worker node 
then it tells container runtime to run the pod or stop , restart 

## CONTROLLER TO POD FLOW ##

### Controller (Master Node)
- continuously monitors the cluster state via API Server
- checks if any pod is missing / crashed / not matching desired state
- if action is needed, controller updates the API Server with instructions
  - example: “Pod XYZ should run on Node1”

### API Server
- receives instructions from controller
- stores desired state in etcd
- notifies the kubelet on the target Worker Node

### Kubelet (on Worker Node)
- reads the desired state from API Server
- compares with actual state of pods on that node
- if pod is not running, kubelet tells container runtime to start the pod

### Container Runtime (containerd)
- actually pulls the image if needed
- starts the container(s) for the pod
- kubelet monitors the pod and reports back to API Server



## Pods 

this is a small unit of kubernetes 
the kubernetes manages the pods not the containers 
we can have multiple container inside the pod (mostly we have only one)
pod will have ip and all container inside that pod will have  same ip

this is gust a wrapper around the container that helps 
kubernetes to handle lifecycle of them like autoscaling, auto healing, managing it  at cluster level  

easy for communicating cluster-wide valid ip  not a host or node limited ip 
no port conflicts like docker containers
