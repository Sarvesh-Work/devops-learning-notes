### kubernetes ###

kubernetes is an orchestration platform.

an orchestration platform is a system that automatically manages the deployment, scaling, networking, and operation of containers or services across multiple machines.

# docker problems:

1. docker does not support auto scaling: 
   consider we have an application running inside a container. suddenly the user load increases and the single container will be overwhelmed by the requests.
   at this time we need to set up multiple containers manually. but we cannot predict the load so manually adding or removing containers is hard.

2. auto healing / container management: 
   consider we have multiple containers on an ec2 instance and one of them goes down. 
   docker does not track which container goes down, so we need to monitor manually. it cannot restart failed containers automatically.

3. does not have enterprise-level features like:
   - load balancing
   - firewall
   - auto scaling
   - api gateway

4. single host problem:
   docker is installed on one host computer / ec2 and has limited cpu, ram, etc. handling multiple containers on a single host is hard. 
   even if we create a new ec2 and run containers there, tracking all containers is difficult. 
   we would need to ssh manually, check container health, and handle load balancing ourselves.

kubernetes solves most of these problems (not 100% but it is gradually evolving) and has a big community.
