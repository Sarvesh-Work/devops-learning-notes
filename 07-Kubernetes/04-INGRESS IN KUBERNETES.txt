#### INGRESS IN KUBERNETES ####

What Is Ingress  
ingress is a k8s component that works like an entry gate for all external traffic comming into the cluster  
it helps expose many servics running inside the cluster using single external ip or load balancer  
it handles routing based on path or host rules

# WHY WE NEED INGRESS  
without ingress if we expose multiple services each service will need its own load balancer or nodeport  
this increases cost and makes things more messy because each service gets a seperate public ip  
also dns ssl and routing will need to be managed speratly for each service  

# EXAMPLE WITHOUT INGRESS  
suppose we have two services frontend and backend  
each has three pods  
if we expose both using service type loadbalancer  
then  
- two separate aws load balancers will be created  
- each will have its own public ip  
- you will need two dns entries like  
   frontend.myapp.com - lb1  
   backend.myapp.com - lb2  
- you will also need to manage ssl certificates separately for both  
- you cannot easily do path based routing like /api goes to backend and / goes to frontend  
- features like rate limiting or authentication will need to be added in each service separately  

# PROBLEM SOLVED BY INGRESS  
ingress controller creates only one external load balancer  
it sits in front of all services and decides where to send traffic based on rules  
so cost is less and management becomes easy  
you can manage tls dns and routing rules from one place  
you can also apply security rules like allow or deny lists globally. (white listing , black listing )  

# EXAMPLE WITH INGRESS USING YOUR CASE  
suppose you have two projects notes app and ecommerce app  
you create two namespaces notes and ecommerce  
inside notes you have services like frontend backend  
inside ecommerce you also have frontend backend  
now each project can have its own ingress  
notes ingress handles routes like  
   notes.example.com - notes frontend service  
   notes.example.com/api - notes backend service  
ecommerce ingress handles routes like  
   shop.example.com - ecommerce frontend service  
   shop.example.com/api - ecommerce backend service  
both ingresses will get their own load balancers but within each project services are managed under that single lb  
so everything stays organized dns is seprate for each project ssl is managed at ingress level and you get isolation using namespaces.  

# KEY FEATURES OF INGRESS  
- path based routing  
- host based routing  
- single entry point  
- centralized tls ssl handling  
- authentication and rate limiting at one place  
- easy management and cost saving  

# NAMESPACE RELATION WITH INGRESS  
namespace works like a folder inside your cluster  
you can have separate ingress resources inside each namespace  
so resources of one project never conflict with another  
for example notes frontend service and ecommerce frontend service can have same name because they live in different namespaces  

ingress is like a smart traffic manager  
it recives all external requests from the internet.
based on host and path rules it sends them to correct service inside cluster  
it reduces cost simplifies dns and ssl management and keeps traffic flow clean and centralised
