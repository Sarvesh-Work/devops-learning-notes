aws cli docs -- > https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/

--connect to Ec2 instance through the terminal

--best terminal to use for windows are :

Putty

Mobaxterm

NoMachine

--so to connect the aws Ec2 instance steps :

open the terminal

do ssh -i pem file location username and public ipAddress (not the private one it is only for aws internal uses)

ssh -> this means linux secure shell
username -> eg --> ec2-user, ubuntu, centos depending on ami
ip Addresses -> eg ipv4 - 3.56.123.45
-i -> identity file (private key file to use for authentication)

eg --> ssh -i /Downloads/user/test.pem ubuntu@3.56.123.45

note --> before using the pem file change its permissions if needed
using chmod 600 file location / chmod u=rw,go= file location

--from aws ui

go to your aws Ec2 instance and click on connect

to delete the Ec2 instance

stop the instance

terminate the instance

so the billing will stop
