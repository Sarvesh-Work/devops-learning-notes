---introduction to devops---

--what is devops--

devops is a culture that improves how we deliver apps by focusing on quality automation and speed its not only about delivering fast but also making sure the product is good we automate manual tasks so things get done faster but still keep quality by doing proper monitoring and continuous testing after automating and improving delivery we keep an eye on the system to catch any issues and fix them testing is important in devops we test the updated app automated tasks and the overall product to make sure everything works well so basically devops is about improving app delivery by combining automation monitoring and testing

--example basic explanation of devops--

imagine we have a website called example.com we built version 2 of it now we need to make it live in production without devops this could take 2 weeks but if we have a devops engineer they can cut that down to 1 week or even 5 days by automating stuff making sure quality is good and doing monitoring and testing along the way

--why devops--

around 10 years ago devops wasnt really a thing everything was manual developers made the app testers tested it system admins set up servers and release engineers deployed it for example to put an app online first the server admin would set up the application server then the release engineer would put the app on it this needed many roles and a lot of time devops came in to speed up these manual steps and improve delivery in the future there will be more tools to make things even easier just like ai is speeding up development now devops came to make things better and faster
